## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Shivani Hibare! I recently completed my **Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech)** in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering from **IIT Kharagpur**. My passion lies in applying **Natural Language Processing**, **Traditional Machine Learning Models**, and **Time Series Analysis** to solve real-world problems. I'm especially excited about building intelligent, explainable systems that can understand and generate human-like language.

I have worked on multilingual voice cloning, RAG systems, and NLP-based question generation. While my academic background is rooted in materials science, my projects increasingly reflect a shift toward **AI-first problem solving** across diverse domains.
